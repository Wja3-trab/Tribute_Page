        <h3>Who are the characters of Kingdom Hearts 1</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Sora: The one who fights the Heartless. Upon reclaiming Keyblade from his rival Riku, Sora sacrificed his heart to free Kairi and became a Heartless. Kari's deep feelings for Sora restored him. Now he must confront Ansem, the seeker of darkness.</li>
          <li>Riku: When Kairi lost her heart, Riku allied himself with Maleficent to save her. Riku was actually the rightful master of the Keyblade, but once he chose darkness over light, the weapon chose Sora instead. Ansem exploited Riku's weakness of heart and possessed him.</li>
          <li>Kairi: Kairi, Sora and Riku always hung out together. When their island vanished, Kairi lost her heart. It turned out that it was hidden within Sora's. As one of the princesses with the power to unlock the secret Keyhole, Kairi restored Sora's heart when he was turned into a Heartless.</li>
          <li>Donald Duck: Royal magician. Skilled in magic, but short-tempered and stubborn. Because Mickey said to follow the key bearer he once left Sora to follow Riku. But friendship soon led him back to Sora. Donald made his screen debut in "The Wise Little Hen"(1934).</li>
          <li>Goofy: Captain of the royal knights. He avoids fighting whenever possible. Mickey's most loyal subject. Because Mickey said to follow the key bearer he once, he once left Sora to follow Riku. But friendship soon led him back to Sora. Goofy made his first screen appearance in "Mickey's Revue" (1932).</li>
        </ul>

        <p>"Kingdom Hearts is great, largely because it successfully captures the spirit both of Square and Disney in a single game."</p>
